# Deno server ðŸ¦•

Deno server is a lightweight content server framework for [Deno](https://deno.land). It supports:

* Regular expression URL matching.
* Static and dynamic handlers.
* Content Type detection for static files.
* Templating for dynamic routes.

The project is still under development and its API will probably change, but youâ€™re more than welcome to check it out and play with the example project for a flavour of how it works.

## Third-party dependencies

* [mime-db](https://unpkg.com/browse/mime-db@1.44.0/) for serving files with the correct Content-Type.

The example project also depends on:

* [marked](https://unpkg.com/marked@1.0.0/lib/marked.esm.js) for parsing Markdown files.
