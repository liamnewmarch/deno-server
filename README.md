# Deno server ðŸ¦•

Deno server is a lightweight content server framework for [Deno][deno]. It supports:

* Regular expression URL matching.
* Static and dynamic handlers.
* Content Type detection for static files.
* Templating for dynamic routes.

The project is still under development and its API will probably change, but youâ€™re more than welcome to check it out and play with the example project for a flavour of how it works.

## Third-party dependencies

* [mime-db][mime-db] for serving files with the correct Content-Type.

The example project also depends on:

* [marked][marked] for parsing Markdown files.
